# YtDownloader
In this project, I'm creating a YouTube downloader using a combination of Pytube, SQLite, and tkinter. This application not only allows users to download YouTube videos but also stores downloaded video information in a local database in a relaitional manner for easy access and management. With this tool, users can conveniently download and organize their favorite YouTube content while keeping track of essential video details through a user-friendly interface. In order to begin using the app you should create an sqlite database using the create_player_database.py script. The database should be placed in the same directory as the two other python scripts.
